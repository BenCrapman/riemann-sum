Note: The only variable that you can use is x. All numerical constants should be written as decimals (e.g. 3 should be written as 3.0)

how said function is read : how said function must be written

Basic Functions
x to the power of b : x ** b
a times x : a * x
a divided by x : a / x
x rounded up : math.ceil(x)
x rounded down : math.floor(x)
absolute value of x : math.fabs(x)
e to the x : math.exp(x)

Trigonometric Functions (angles in radians)
sin of x : math.sin(x)
cos of x : math.cos(x)
tan of x : math.tan(x)
arcsin of x : math.asin(x)
arccos of x : math.acos(x)
arctan of x : math.atan(x)

Constants
pi : math.pi
euler's number : math.e

more functions can be found in the python math library.
